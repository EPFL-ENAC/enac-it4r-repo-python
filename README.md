## How to use this template ?

1. Create a brand new Github repository to host your project.
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. 
1. Install Cookiecutter: If you haven't already, you need to install Cookiecutter on your system. You can use pip, the Python package manager, to install Cookiecutter by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install cookiecutter  
    ```

1. Generate the project from the template by running the following command with a command prompt or terminal from the clone repository location :

    ```bash
    cookiecutter https://github.com/EPFL-ENAC/enac-it4r-repo-python
    ```
 1. Provide input values: Cookiecutter will prompt you for input values to customize the generated project. The template may define variables or placeholders that need to be filled in. Answer the prompts with the desired values to configure your project.

1. Generate the project: After providing all the necessary input values, Cookiecutter will generate the project based on the template. It will create a new directory with the generated project structure and files.

1. Customize the project: Once the project is generated, you can navigate to the newly created directory and start customizing the project according to your requirements. You can modify files, add additional dependencies, configure settings, and make any other necessary changes.
