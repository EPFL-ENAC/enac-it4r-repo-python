## Python installation

For a quick guide to installing Python and setting it up, please take a look at the [ENAC-IT4R Python webpage](https://www.notion.so/Python-quick-setup-55d1e813f24d4a37a57e14c71c641a0e).

## Project settings

All external packages are defined into the `pyproject.toml`.



## Project installation

To install the project dependencies, run `pip` as follows:

```bash
pip install .
```

The `pyproject.toml` contains the `[project.optional-dependencies]` selection to define the development dependencies:



To install these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```


## Virtual environment

While not mandatory, utilizing a virtual environment is recommended. Using a virtual environment for installing packages provides isolation of dependencies, easier package management, easier maintenance, improved security, and improved development
workflow.

To set up a virtual environment with venv, follow these steps :

- Windows: Create a virtual environment with venv

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    cd venv/Scripts
    activate
    ```

- Mac/Linux: Create a virtual environment with venv:

    ```bash
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
